            An array of metrics returned as type value pairs.
            The values are the +/- percentage change (i.e. delta) between the previous two test runs.
            The delta value can be a single number, an object, or an array of objects.
            The comparison is only created for data that is common between the two files.
            If a piece of data is missing from one of the two files, a "Data unavailable" message will be returned for that given piece of data, alongside the successfully compared data.
