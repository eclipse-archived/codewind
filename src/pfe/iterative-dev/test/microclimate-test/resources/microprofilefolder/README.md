### Summary

The IBM Cloud Microservice Starter for Java - MicroProfile / Java EE provides a starting point for creating Java microservice applications running on [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/).

To deploy this application to IBM Cloud using a toolchain click the **Create Toolchain** button.
[![Create Toolchain](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

### Requirements
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* Java 8: Any compliant JVM should work.
  * [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  * [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/),
    or [Download a Liberty server package](https://developer.ibm.com/assets/wasdev/#filter/assetTypeFilters=PRODUCT)
    that contains the IBM JDK (Windows, Linux)

### Configuration
The application is configured to provide JAX-RS REST capabilities, JNDI, JSON parsing and Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI).

These capabilities are provided through dependencies in the pom.xml file and Liberty features enabled in the server config file found in `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`.

### Project contents
The microservice application has a health endpoint which is accessible at `<host>:<port>/microprofilefolderimporttest/health`. The context root is set in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` file. The ports are set in the pom.xml file and exposed to the CLI in the cli-config.yml file.

The project contains IBM Cloud specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of a IBM Cloud DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the IBM Cloud toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in IBM Cloud, the timeout value during deployment and which services to bind to.


Credentials are either taken from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable that IBM Cloud provides or from environment variables passed in by JNDI (see the server config file `src/main/liberty/config/server.xml`).

### Run

To build and run the application:
1. `mvn install`
1. `mvn liberty:run-server`


To run the application in Docker use the Docker file called `Dockerfile`. If you do not want to install Maven locally you can use `Dockerfile-tools` to build a container with Maven installed.

### Endpoints

The application exposes the following endpoints:
* Health endpoint: `<host>:<port>/<contextRoot>/health`

The context root is set in the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ibm-web-ext.xml` file. The ports are set in the pom.xml file and exposed to the CLI in the cli-config.yml file.
